Once the McStas simulations (instructions [here](https://github.com/emmarant/ALDELE/tree/master/create_data/mcstas_simulations#setting-up-mcstas-simulations) ) are completed, the next step is to convert their ASCII output to images.
To do so, edit the file _'savejpg.py'_ accordingly  (part indicated as 'input')
