## Creating images from McStas *.dat files

Once the McStas simulations (instructions [here](https://github.com/emmarant/ALDELE/tree/master/create_data/mcstas_simulations#setting-up-mcstas-simulations) ) are completed, the next step is to convert their ASCII output to images.

To do so, 
1. edit the file __'savejpg.py'__ accordingly  (part indicated as *'Input required by user'*), and then
2. run the file:
 
                      $ python savejpg.py
