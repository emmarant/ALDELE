## Creating simulated data for DL model training

1. First we need to run McStas simulations. 
2. Then we create *.jpg images from the output of the simulations.



## Download and use existing datasets

A variety of different datasets already exist and can be downloaded to train models with.
The list below, gives a comprehensive description of these ready datasets, including the links to download them from
