## How to train a model using one of the python notebooks in this directory

Assumes you already have a set of images to train on. If not, follow instructions as explained [here](https://github.com/emmarant/ALDELE/tree/master/create_data#creating-simulated-data-for-dl-model-training)

Step 1. Choose which notebook matches the model type you want to train: i) single-angle misalignment, ii) double-angle misalignment

Step 2.

Step 3. Run the notebook. The file 'running _environment' provides the contents of an indicative conda environment where the notebook has been successfully run. Similar environments (i.e. similar library and software versions) should also work.
